This project name "YPCnv", or "ypcnv", is abbreviation and should be unwrapped
as "Yellow Pages Converter".

This is yet another one more tool to work with phonebook entries. Once I tried
to deploy my phonebook inside my new device. I did a try to evacuate contacts
from MS based hand held device. It was not easy to get my data back from MS
technology, and I got an idea of this tool, or toolbox. Also the tool is aimed
to help with batch processing of v-card files, in case when an acceptor device
did not fully (in an way obvious for a human) support them.
